RELEASE NOTES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.5 - April 11 2009
* Fixed minor issues with exiting ColorBox.
  

Version 1.1.4 - April 08 2009
* Fixed a bug in the fade transition where ColorBox not close completely if instructed to close during the
  fade-in portion of the transition.


Version 1.1.3 - April 06 2009
* Fixed an IE6&7 issue with using ColorBox to display animated GIFs.


Version 1.1.2 - April 05 2009
* Added ability to change content when ColorBox is already open.
* Added vertical photo centering now works for all browsers (this feature previously excluded IE6&7).
* Added namespacing to the esc-key keydown event for people who want to disable it: "keydown.colorClose"
* Added 'title' setting to add the ability to set an alternative title for any ColorBox call.
* Fixed rollover navigation issue with IE8. (Added JS-based rollover state due to a browser-bug.)
* Fixed an overflow issue for when the fixed width/height is smaller than the size of a photo.
* Fixed a bug in the fade transition where the border would still come up if ColorBox was
  closed mid-transition.
* Switch from JSMin to Yui Compressor for minification.  Minified code now under 7KB.


Version 1.1.1 - March 31 2009
* More robust image detection regex.  Now detects image file types with url fragments and/or query strings.
* Added 'nofollow' exception to rel grouping.
* Changed how images are loaded into the DOM to prevent premature size calculation by ColorBox.
* Added timestamp to iframe name to prevent caching - this was a problem in some browsers if the user had
  multiple iframes and the visitor left the page and came back, or if they refreshed the page.


Version 1.1.0 - March 21 2009
  Major Changes:
* Animation is now much smoother and less resource intensive.
* Added support for % sizing.
* Callback option added.
* Inline content now preserves JavaScript events, and changes made while ColorBox is open are also preserved.
* Added 'href' setting to add the ability to set an alternative href for any anchor, or to assign the
  ColorBox event to non-anchors.  
  Example: $('button').colorbox({'href':'process.php'})
  Example: $('a[href='http://msn.com']).colorbox({'href':'http://google.com', iframe:true});
  
  Minor Changes:
* Photos are now horizontally centered if they are smaller than the lightbox size.  Also vertically centered
  for browsers newer than IE7.
* Buttons in the examples are now included in the 'protected zone'.  The lightbox will never expand it's 
  borders or buttons beyond an accessible area of the screen.
* Keypress events don't queue up by holding down the arrow keys.
* Added option to close ColorBox by clicking on the background overlay.
* Added 'none' transition setting.
* Changed 'contentIframe' and 'contentInline' to 'inline' and 'iframe'.  Removed 'contentAjax' because it
  is automatically assumed for non-image file types.
* Changed 'contentWidth' and 'contentHeight' to 'fixedWidth' and 'fixedHeight'.  These sizes now reflect
  the total size of the lightbox, not just the inner content.  This is so users can accurately anticipate
  % sizes without fear of creating scrollbars.
* Clicking on a photo will now switch to the next photo in a set.
* Loading.gif is more stable in it's position.
* Added a minified version.
* Code passes JSLint.


Version 1.0.5 - March 11 2009
* Redo: Fixed a bug where IE would cut off the bottom portion of a photo, if the photo was larger than 
  the document dimensions.


Version 1.0.4 - March 10 2009
* Added an option to allow users to automatically open the lightbox.  
  Example usage: $(".colorbox").colorbox({open:true});
* Fixed a bug where IE would cut off the bottom portion of a photo, 
  if the photo was larger than the document dimensions.


Version 1.0.3 - March 09 2009
* Fixed vertical centering for Safari 3.0.x.


Version 1.0.2 - March 06 2009
* Corrected a typo.
* Changed the content-type check so that it does not assume all links to photos should actually 
  display photos.  This allows for Ajax/inline/and iframe calls on anchors linking to picture file types.


Version 1.0.1 - March 05 2009
* Fixed keydown events (esc, left arrow, right arrow) for Webkit browsers.


Version 1.0 - March 03 2009
* First release
